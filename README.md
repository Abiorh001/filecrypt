# File Encryption System Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the File Encryption System. This system is designed to provide secure and efficient file, folder, and text encryption, allowing users to manage their encrypted data seamlessly. The system is built using a modular monolithic architecture and utilizes technologies such as Django REST framework, Redis, Celery, PostgreSQL, Silk, and DataDog.

## User Workflow and Activities

## 1. User Registration and Authentication:

- **Feature:** Users register and authenticate on the platform.
  
  - **Benefit:** Registration enables users to create unique accounts and access the full suite of encryption features after authentication.
  - **Additional Details:** Role-based access controls, user/group permissions, and compartmentalized data access implemented between teams to enhance security.

## 2. User Workspace and Team Collaboration:

- **Feature:** After registration, users can create workspaces and add team members.
- **Benefit:** Facilitates organized collaboration within specific workspaces, ensuring data segregation and enhanced privacy.

- **Additional Detail:** Team members can securely access encrypted files within the workspace, and collaboration is further secured through individual user authentication.

## 3. File, Folder, or Text Encryption:

- **Feature:** Users interact with the system to choose between file, folder, or text encryption.
- **Benefit:** Provides flexibility to secure different types of data based on user requirements.

- **Additional Detail:** The recursive process for folder encryption ensures that all files within the folder are encrypted, and the system maintains the original folder structure during encryption for user convenience.

## 4. File Upload and Encryption:

- **Feature:** Users upload files, folders, or input text for encryption.
- **Benefit:** Enables users to secure their data with a unique key using a strong symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES).

- **Additional Detail:** Paid users have the option to choose their preferred encryption algorithm from a provided list, tailoring the level of security to their specific needs. Encrypted content and metadata are stored in the database for future retrieval.

## 5. File and Key Sharing:

- **Feature:** Users have the option to share encrypted files with others.
- **Benefit:** Facilitates secure sharing through mechanisms like temporary links or user authentication, ensuring controlled access to shared files.

- **Additional Detail:** Users can securely share encryption keys with trusted individuals, enhancing collaboration while maintaining security.

## 6. File Retrieval and Decryption:

- **Feature:** Users log in securely and retrieve files based on filename, filetag, or date uploaded.
- **Benefit:** Ensures authorized users can securely retrieve and decrypt their files.

- **Additional Detail:** The retrieval process involves user input of the encryption key. If the keys match, the file is decrypted, ensuring only authorized users can access the content.

## 7. Secure Download Options:

- **Feature:** Users can view the content of their file and securely download the decrypted file.
- **Benefit:** Provides users with secure options, including temporary links or direct downloads, ensuring the integrity of the downloaded content.

## 8. Optional Email Integration:

- **Feature:** Users can choose to receive their encryption key via email or text-message.
- **Benefit:** Offers convenient delivery options based on user preferences, with a focus on secure email protocols and end-to-end encryption.

## 9. Scheduled Encryption and Decryption:

- **Feature:** Users can schedule file encryption or decryption.
- **Benefit:** Automation enhances user control, allowing encryption or decryption to align with preferred timelines.

- **Additional Detail:** Users can set a specific time and date for automatic encryption during the file upload process. The scheduling feature ensures flexibility and efficiency in managing encryption or decryption tasks.

## 10. Alerts and Notifications:

- **Feature:** Users receive alerts for various actions, including file access activity.  
- **Benefit:** Keeps users informed in real-time, enabling timely actions.

- **Additional Detail:** 
  - Alerts include details such as source IP address, file accessed, and timestamp to support security investigations.

## 11. User-Controlled Key Management:

- **Feature:** Users manage and can rotate their encryption keys.
- **Benefit:** Empowers users to actively participate in their security by managing and rotating encryption keys.

- **Additional Detail:** Users are educated on best practices for key management, ensuring they make informed decisions about their encryption keys.

## 12. File Management and Tagging:

- **Feature:** Users can organize and manage their encrypted files through a comprehensive file management system.
- **Benefit:** Tagging functionality allows users to add descriptive tags to files for easy tracking and searching.

- **Additional Detail:** File organization is enhanced through tagging, providing users with efficient tools for managing and locating their encrypted files.

## 13. Size Limits and Communication:

- **Feature:** Size limits are implemented for uploads to manage server resources.
- **Benefit:** Efficiently manages server resources and ensures clear communication of size limits to users.

- **Additional Detail:** Throughout the upload process, secure communication channels are maintained to safeguard data integrity.

## 14. User Limits for Free Accounts:

- **Feature:** Free users have limitations on the number of encryption keys, encryption algorithms, file sizes, workspaces, team members, and total storage space.
- **Benefit:** Balances usability with resource considerations for free accounts.

- **Additional Detail:** Free users are provided with clear limits on various features, encouraging them to explore premium options for expanded capabilities.

## 15. Logging and Auditing:

- **Feature:** The system logs user activities, especially key-related operations.
- **Benefit:** Regular auditing of logs contributes to security and compliance.

- **Additional Detail:** Regular auditing ensures a comprehensive record of user actions, providing valuable insights for security and compliance purposes.

## 16. Security Audits and Continuous Improvement:

- **Feature:** Regular security audits are conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- **Benefit:** Ensures a consistently high level of system security and user satisfaction.

- **Additional Detail:** User feedback is actively collected and used to inform continuous improvements to the system, enhancing overall user experience and security.

## System Architecture

The File Encryption System follows a modular monolithic architecture. Key components include:

1. **Django REST Framework:**
   - Used for building the RESTful API.

2. **Redis:**
   - Acts as a message broker for Celery.

3. **Celery:**
   - Manages asynchronous tasks such as encryption and email processing.

4. **PostgreSQL:**
   - Serves as the relational database for storing user data, encrypted content, and metadata.

5. **Silk:**
   - Provides performance monitoring and profiling for Django applications.

6. **DataDog:**
   - Integrated for comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and analytics.
